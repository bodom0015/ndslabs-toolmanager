# Analysis Toolbox

The Analysis Toolbox provides the ability to configure and launch analysis environments like RStudio and Jupyter Notebooks near the data.  
It began as a feature of the [TERRA-REF](http://terraref.org) project to provide analysis capabilities in Clowder.  The service
has since been extended to work with other services, such as Dataverse or DSpace.
